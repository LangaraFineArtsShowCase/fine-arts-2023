                Congratulations to you, the graduates! You stuck with a program
                that required many long days and sleepless nights. You fought

                difficult media. During this process you developed your ideas
                and imagery, defining your artistic voice. These years of hard
                work and dedication have brought you one step closer to your
                future goals.
